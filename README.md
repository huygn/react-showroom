# react-compdoc

TODO

- [x] get component props data and render example `.mdx` with MDX.
- [] live example that is editable
- [] load custom CSS
- [] customize webpack plugin

Something like `react-styleguidist`, but use MDX for example and `esbuild` for playground so you can have example in TypeScript.
