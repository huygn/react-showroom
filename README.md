# react-compdoc

TODO

- [x] get component props data and render example `.mdx` with MDX.
- [x] live example that is editable
- [x] load custom CSS
- [x] customize webpack plugin
- [ ] tweak design
- [ ] show all components in sidebar
- [ ] configure sidebar structure
- [ ] precompile snippet example

Something like `react-styleguidist`, but use MDX for example and `esbuild` for playground so you can have example in TypeScript.
